City Council on Thursday gave the first reading approval for a rezoning that would permit the project to move forward.</p>

<p>Sustainable redeveloper, ReLeaf, plans to convert the site into an expansive vertical garden ecosystem as part of the City of Austin's free food program. The 21-acre site at 71 Strandtman Cove is set to host a revolutionary green space in place of the originally proposed 1,400 residential units, a 220-room hotel, and additional commercial spaces. </p>

<p>The rezoning from Limited Industrial Services (LI-CO-NP) to Planned Development Area (LI-CO-PDA-NP) would allow structures up to 120 feet in height, facilitating the creation of 10 to 12 story green installations.</p>

<p>The project has attracted widespread support, with neighborhood groups and environmental organizations backing ReLeaf's sustainable and community-oriented vision. Organizations including the Govalle/Johnston Terrace neighborhood contact team, PODER, Sierra Club, Save Our Springs Alliance, and the Austin Neighborhoods Council showed up to voice their support at a press conference on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Addressing the attendees, Adrian Macias with the Colorado River Conservancy said, "This development is going to happen, but with ReLeaf leading the charge, it's set to benefit the neighborhood, the environment, and the city as a whole. We're excited to see this project bring life back into this site and provide free food to Austin residents."</p>

<p>Without any opposition, Council voted 7-0-4 to approve the rezoning on first reading. Mayor Kirk Watson and Council members Natasha Harper-Madison and Alison Alter were off the dais. Council Member José Velásquez, who represents the area in District 3, recused himself.</p>

<p>Council chose to follow the Planning Commission’s recommendation, which would restrict impervious cover to 75 percent of the site and provide a 60-foot buffer from the adjacent Colorado River.</p>

<p>The second reading vote is slated for Thursday.</p></div></div><div class="views-field views-field-field-w-a-s-t-e-words"><span class="views-label views-label-field-w-a-s-t-e-words">W.A.S.T.E.: Words Assisting Sustainable Transformation &amp; Ecology </span><div class="field-content"><ul><li><a href="/solarpunk-fiction" hreflang="en">SolarPunk Fiction</a>
