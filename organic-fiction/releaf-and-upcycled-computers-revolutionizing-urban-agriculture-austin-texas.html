By repurposing the discarded computers, ReLeaf brings them back to life, keeping with the organization's ethos of waste reduction.</p><p>Moreover, using these Green PCs is about more than just cost-saving; it's an environmentally conscious choice. ReLeaf's decision to refurbish instead of buying new reduces the demand for new devices and their associated manufacturing emissions. The initiative also decreases electronic waste, a rapidly growing environmental problem.</p><p>To ensure the refurbished computers are robust enough for their new roles, ReLeaf adopted PC Officina's standard for hardware: a minimum of a Core i3 processor or equivalent, eight gigs of RAM, and a 128GB SATA drive.</p><p>Moreover, the cooperative chose the Linux Mint 21 with Xfce edition for its modest hardware requirements and long support life-cycle. This operating system's point-and-click GUI and ease of installation of third-party drivers make it a user-friendly choice for ReLeaf's unique application.</p><p>ReLeaf's new initiative is yet another testament to its innovative and sustainable approach to urban farming and waste management. Through their work, they showcase how repurposed technology can contribute to environmental sustainability, reinforcing Austin's reputation as a hub of green innovation.</p></div></div><div class="views-field views-field-field-w-a-s-t-e-words"><span class="views-label views-label-field-w-a-s-t-e-words">W.A.S.T.E.: Words Assisting Sustainable Transformation &amp; Ecology </span><div class="field-content"><ul><li><a href="/upcycling.html" hreflang="en">Upcycling</a>
