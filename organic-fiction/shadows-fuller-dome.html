This gargantuan geodesic marvel, a testament to Buckminster Fuller's genius, was a new addition to Mueller's dreamscape. As much as the Dome was a subject of communal mockery, it pulled at Emory with an inexplicable gravity.</p>

<p>The trails were Emory’s sanctuary, a place where he felt connected to the shifting reality of Mueller's landscape. His daily strolls would always lead him to the Fuller Dome. He found himself increasingly entranced by its reflective surface that danced in the sunlight, casting eerie, kaleidoscopic shadows onto the surrounding trails.</p>

<p>Emory’s fascination with the Dome took a turn one sunny afternoon when he discovered that at a certain time of the day, the shadow of the Dome pointed to a peculiar patch of 'Strawbactus,' a weird hybrid fruit that was part strawberry, part cactus. Intrigued, he took a bite and was surprised by its exotic flavor. A strange idea germinated in Emory's mind. What if the Dome and the Strawbactus were linked somehow? What if the Dome was more than it appeared on its surface? </p>

<p>It was on one such day of musings that Emory noticed the East Side parrots perched on the Dome. Their squawks seemed to emulate human speech with a distinct Texas drawl. His curiosity piqued, he started noting down their repetitive phrases. They seemed like nonsensical chatter until, in a stroke of insight, he thought to plot the phrases onto the trails around the Fuller Dome.</p>

<p>The result was a map, a path suggested by the parrots' words, pointing towards an unexplored part of the trail system, running along the quiet Tannehill Creek. Filled with a mix of trepidation and excitement, Emory decided to follow this new path. As he delved deeper into the Mueller trails, guided by parrot chatter and the cryptic shadow of the Fuller Dome, he would soon discover secrets about Mueller that no one else knew, shrouded in mystery and surrealism.</p></div></div><div class="views-field views-field-field-w-a-s-t-e-words"><span class="views-label views-label-field-w-a-s-t-e-words">W.A.S.T.E.: Words Assisting Sustainable Transformation &amp; Ecology </span><div class="field-content"><ul><li><a href="/trails.html" hreflang="en">Trails</a>
