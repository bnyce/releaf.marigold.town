<p><em>What does being part of the ReLeaf community mean to you?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In response to this profound question, we've curated a catalog to celebrate all the strides we've made together for a greener Austin in the last 20 years. This commemoration spans everything related to ReLeaf's initiatives, from urban vertical gardens to eco-friendly architecture and public green spaces, and of course, our extensive work in advocacy and education. </p>

<p>We've collated submissions from contributors from every corner of Austin and beyond through an open call that happened in 2043 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ReLeaf community. Contributors shared their transformation journeys of barren fences into thriving ecosystems, the stunning green architecture they've built, community gardening events they organized, permaculture workshops they conducted, and everything in between. </p>

<p>This expansive catalog includes before-and-after photos of transformed spaces, architectural blueprints, community event pictures, heartwarming stories, and a vivid collection of 'ReLeaf Diaries', where contributors recount their experiences with greening their local environments. </p>

<p>In the past 20 years, ReLeaf has fostered a green revolution in Austin, transforming the city's physical landscape while shifting cultural perspectives towards urban environments. And this journey wouldn't have been possible without the passionate and dedicated members of the ReLeaf community.</p>

<p>So here's to 20 years of ReLeaf, to every green wall and rooftop garden, to every seed planted and every tree grown. But more than anything, here's to each one of you, who believed in the vision of a greener Austin and made it a reality. </p>

<p>As we leaf through these pages, we not only celebrate what we've achieved but also look forward to the continued growth of our urban green oasis. The future is verdant and vibrant, and it begins with us, here in Austin, with ReLeaf.<br />
