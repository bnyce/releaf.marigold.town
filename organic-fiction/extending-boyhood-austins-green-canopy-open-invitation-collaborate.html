<p>I trust this note finds you in good spirits and good health. I'm Bryce, part of the team at ReLeaf – a community-led initiative that's turning Austin's public spaces into vertical gardens. These gardens serve not only as sources of sustenance but as living canvases telling the stories of our city.</p>

<p>Your work, especially "Boyhood" and "Dazed and Confused", resonates deeply with the people of Austin, becoming part of our city's cultural fabric. These films capture Austin's spirit in a way few others have. And in "Boyhood," the notion of time passing and the changes it brings is a theme that aligns beautifully with our mission at ReLeaf. </p>

<p>I'm writing to invite you to collaborate with us on a project that has the potential to intertwine your cinematic legacy with Austin's ever-evolving landscape. Imagine if the locations from your films were linked to ReLeaf gardens, extending your story of growing up in Austin into the physical spaces of our city. This could serve as an innovative extension of your pioneering 12-year filming of "Boyhood," with the narrative continuing to evolve as our gardens grow and flourish.</p>

<p>This endeavor wouldn't just pay tribute to your cinematic achievements – it would bring the locations of your movies to life in a new, greener context, promoting sustainability and community connection. Just as Mason grows and evolves in "Boyhood," so too would the sites associated with him, offering a potent symbol of Austin's progression towards a sustainable future.</p>

<p>If this idea piques your interest, I would be thrilled to discuss it further with you. Our team at ReLeaf is flexible, innovative, and eager to partner with fellow Austinites who share our commitment to enhancing our city. </p>

<p>We understand you may have questions or require more details. Please feel free to contact me directly at your convenience. We hope you'll consider this invitation to join us in adding another layer to Austin's story, making it even more vibrant and sustainable.</p>

<p>Looking forward to the potential of creating something unique and meaningful for the city we both love.</p>

<p>Warm regards,</p>

<p>Bryce<br />
