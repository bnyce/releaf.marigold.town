Today, they were going to construct another VertiFlow system, this second one an improvement over their first attempt. They'd been excited about getting started since they first heard of it at a ReLeaf meeting a few weeks prior and building on their experience they already had some ideas for arranging the next vertical garden in new and subtly pleasing ways. </p><p>Taylor loved plants and found a unique kind of solace in nurturing them. They were drawn to ReLeaf not just for its environmental focus but also for the community's acceptance of all, irrespective of gender identity. As a nonbinary individual, finding spaces of unconditional acceptance was rare, and ReLeaf was one of those exceptional places.</p><p>With a design sketch of the VertiFlow in hand and a collection of empty aluminum cans saved up over weeks, Taylor got to work. They punctured the bottom of each can, upcycling each into a VertiCan. Next they connected them along a central axis with a rag cut into a long strip of cloth that served as a wick. Obscuring all the exposed metal, they wrapped the column in an EcoSleeve fashioned from an upcycled shirt. </p><p>Once the structure stood tall, about as high as they could reach, Taylor stepped back, a sense of achievement washing over them. It was a vertical eco-tower, a synthetic riparian length ready to play host to an array of life.</p><p>The next step was to introduce the plants. Taylor had chosen a range of species, each one selected for its suitability for different levels of the moisture gradient the VertiFlow would create. They started with the water-loving ferns at the top, progressing down to the resilient succulents at the bottom.</p><p>With each plant they introduced, the VertiFlow became more than a mere assembly of cans. It was transforming into a vibrant vertical garden, a testament to nature's tenacity and adaptability.</p><p>As the days passed, Taylor meticulously cared for their vertical garden. They watched as the rainwater trickled down from the top, each can a temporary reservoir nurturing the plants. The VertiFlow system was functioning just as they had imagined, creating a gradation of moisture that benefited each plant exactly as it needed.</p><p>To Taylor, this wasn't just a project; it was a symbol of resilience, an emblem of their journey. Like the VertiFlow, they had thrived against odds, finding their place and identity. The tower stood tall and proud in their backyard, a testament to the power of nature and community. Just like the plants it nurtured, Taylor found themselves growing stronger and more vibrant, rooted in their identity and reaching towards the sky, ready to face whatever came next.</p></div></div><div class="views-field views-field-field-w-a-s-t-e-words"><span class="views-label views-label-field-w-a-s-t-e-words">W.A.S.T.E.: Words Assisting Sustainable Transformation &amp; Ecology </span><div class="field-content"><ul><li><a href="/vertical-garden.html" hreflang="en">Vertical Garden</a>
