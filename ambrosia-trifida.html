      <div class="views-row"><div class="views-field views-field-description__value"><span class="field-content"><p><em><strong>Ambrosia trifida</strong></em>, the <strong>giant ragweed</strong>, is a species of flowering plant in the family <a>Asteraceae</a>. It is native to <a>North America</a>, where it is widespread in <a>Canada</a>, the <a>United States</a>, and northern <a>Mexico</a>.<br />
 </p>

<h2><span>Distribution</span></h2>

<p>It is present in Europe and Asia as an <a>introduced species</a>, and it is known as a common <a>weed</a> in many regions. Its common names include <strong>great ragweed</strong>, <strong>Texan great ragweed</strong>, <strong>giant ragweed</strong>, <strong>tall ragweed</strong>, <strong>blood ragweed</strong>, <strong>perennial ragweed</strong>, <strong>horseweed</strong>,<strong>buffaloweed</strong>, and <strong>kinghead</strong>.</p>

<h2><span>Description</span></h2>

<p>This is an annual herb usually growing up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) tall, but known to reach over 6 m (20 ft) in rich, moist soils. The tough stems have woody bases and are branching or unbranched. Most leaves are oppositely arranged. The blades are variable in shape, sometimes palmate with five lobes, and often with toothed edges. The largest can be over 25 cm (9.8 in) long by 20 cm (7.9 in) wide. They are borne on <a>petioles</a> several centimeters long. They are glandular and rough in texture. The species is <a>monoecious</a>, with plants bearing <a>inflorescences</a> containing both pistillate and staminate flowers. The former are clustered at the base of the spike and the latter grow at the end. The fruit is a <a>bur</a> a few millimeters long tipped with several tiny spines.</p>

<h2><span>As a weed</span></h2>

<p>This species is well known as a <a>noxious weed</a>, both in its native range and in areas where it is an introduced and often <a>invasive species</a>. It is <a>naturalized</a> in some areas, and it is recorded as an <a>adventive species</a> in others. It grows in many types of disturbed habitat, such as roadsides, and in cultivated fields. Widespread <a>seed dispersal</a> occurs when its spiny burs fall off the plant and are carried to new habitat by people, animals, machinery, or flowing water. The plant is destructive to native and crop plants because it easily <a>outcompetes</a>them for light.</p>

<p>Herbicide resistant giant ragweed populations were first identified in the late 1990s. Across much of the midwestern United States, populations resistant to group 2 (ALS-inhibitors) and group 9 (glyphosate) are present, though resistant to multiple herbicide modes of action has not yet been documented. There remains concern that herbicide resistance is more widespread than documented and many states like Minnesota offer free screening of giant ragweed for herbicide resistance. For chemical control, use of group 4 (2-4D) and group 10 (glufosinate) are effective.</p>

<h2><span>As an allergen</span></h2>

<p>Also, interest is great in preventing the spread of this plant because its <a>pollen</a> is a significant human <a>allergen</a>. It is one of the most familiar allergenic ragweeds, and residents of different regions begin to experience allergic symptoms as the plant spreads into the area.</p>

<h2><span>Uses</span></h2>

<p><a>Native Americans</a> had a number of uses for the plant as <a>traditional medicine</a>. The <a>Cherokee</a>used it as a remedy for <a>insect stings</a>, <a>hives</a>, <a>fever</a>, and <a>pneumonia</a>, and the <a>Iroquois</a> used it to treat <a>diarrhea</a>.</p>

<p>Giant ragweed has been used successfully as a <a>compost</a> activator and an ingredient in <a>sheet mulch</a> gardens.</p>
