In this case, the meaningful coincidence – or synchronicity – may be seen in the timely emergence of ReLeaf's model in an era where urban environments and societies are grappling with significant changes such as climate change, urbanization, and resource scarcity. </p>

<p>In a similar vein to how engaging with synchronicity aids in 'rewilding' the psyche, ReLeaf's model may be seen as a process of 'rewilding' urban spaces, connecting them back to nature and leveraging the intrinsic resilience of natural systems. This mirrors the interconnectedness implied in the concept of synchronicity. </p>

<p>The blend of reality and fiction may also relate to ReLeaf's work. In creating Vertical Gardens, they are blending the reality of urban environments with a 'fictional' or envisioned future where nature and urban environments coexist and support each other. This blending resonates with the theme of interconnectedness that runs through the synchronicity concept, reinforcing the idea that our constructed environments and the natural world are not separate, but deeply connected parts of a greater whole. </p>

<p>Klisanin’s mention of an 'antifragile' mindset speaks to the capacity of ReLeaf's model to not only withstand but thrive in the face of challenges. Just as individuals can become more antifragile through recognizing synchronicities and fostering interdependence, cities can also become more antifragile through implementing models like ReLeaf's that work with, rather than against, the natural environment.</p></div></div><div class="views-field views-field-field-w-a-s-t-e-words"><span class="views-label views-label-field-w-a-s-t-e-words">W.A.S.T.E.: Words Assisting Sustainable Transformation &amp; Ecology </span><div class="field-content"><ul><li><a href="/synchronicity.html" hreflang="en">Synchronicity</a>
