Born in 1917 and passing away in 1992, Bohm is celebrated for his innovative work, "Wholeness and the Implicate Order," which introduced a radically new perspective of viewing the cosmos, not as a collection of disparate objects, but as an undivided, flowing whole.</p>

<p>For Bohm, our current fragmented worldview, which perceives reality and consciousness as separate entities, impedes our understanding of the universe and our place within it. He insists that we must instead recognize reality as an "unbroken, unfragmented, borderless whole," where consciousness is not an isolated phenomenon but an integral part of this grand totality. This perspective invites a fundamental shift in how we perceive and interact with the world around us.</p>

<p>Such a worldview doesn't just extend to theoretical physics but also profoundly impacts our understanding of ourselves and society. If we start perceiving ourselves not as separate entities but as integral parts of a holistic universe, we pave the way for harmonious co-existence, both with ourselves and with our environment.</p>

<p>Bohm's view encourages us to examine reality in a way that isn't confined to formal, logical, and mathematical terms, but also embraces intuitive understanding, imagery, and poetic expression. This, according to Bohm, is key to ensuring the harmonious functioning of the mind, fostering an orderly and stable society, and facilitating a constant evolution of our understanding of reality.</p>

<p>Embracing Bohm's vision, we can begin to see how projects like ReLeaf and vertical gardens embody this holistic, interconnected approach. By turning discarded items or underutilized spaces into vibrant, living ecosystems, these initiatives demonstrate the inherent interconnectedness and interdependence of all life forms and our environment, reinforcing Bohm's concept of unbroken wholeness.</p>

<p>Similarly, understanding the intricate 'dance of reality' allows us to better comprehend the interplay between our external reality and internal states. When we perceive our inner thoughts, feelings, and experiences as an integral part of the wider reality, rather than separate from it, we create a more harmonious, holistic existence.</p>

<p>In essence, Bohm's work prompts us to rethink our conventional notions of reality and consciousness. He invites us to embrace an understanding of existence that celebrates unbroken wholeness, interconnectedness, and the endless process of unfolding and evolving. As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, these insights from Bohm's pioneering work continue to hold profound relevance and potential for both individual and societal transformation.</p></div></div><div class="views-field views-field-field-w-a-s-t-e-words"><span class="views-label views-label-field-w-a-s-t-e-words">W.A.S.T.E.: Words Assisting Sustainable Transformation &amp; Ecology </span><div class="field-content"><ul><li><a href="/interconnectedness.html" hreflang="en">Interconnectedness</a>
