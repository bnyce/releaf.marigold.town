<p>ReLeaf, a cooperative owned by its worker members and participating businesses.</p>

<p>HOW IT WORKS</p>

<p>ReLeaf transforms business waste into vertical gardens, thus reducing disposal costs and contributing to environmental sustainability. We utilize unique QR code tracking for full transparency from waste harvesting to installation and maintenance.</p>

<p>PROBLEM</p>

<p>Businesses in Austin generate substantial waste with environmental implications. Disposing of this waste is costly and often not eco-friendly. We aim to solve this issue by repurposing waste as a resource, creating greener, beautiful spaces in the city.</p>

<p>VALIDATION/TRACTION</p>

<p>We have started discussions with businesses who produce waste materials suitable for our project, showing an interest in our innovative solution. We've also submitted an entry for the Austin Circular Economy Showcase and have started prototyping our planter modules.</p>

<p>COMPETITION</p>

<p>Conventional waste haulers, selective waste harvesting companies, and Austin Resource Recovery. We aim to collaborate, not compete, promoting a greener waste management ecosystem.</p>

<p>SOLUTION</p>

<p>ReLeaf offers an innovative solution of transforming waste into lush, vertical gardens. This provides cost savings for businesses, promotes environmental sustainability, and beautifies urban spaces.</p>

<p>WHY NOW</p>

<p>With increasing awareness and concern about environmental sustainability and waste management, now is the perfect time for a solution that addresses these challenges in a unique, cooperative way.</p>

<p>GO TO MARKET STRATEGY</p>

<p>We will partner with businesses generating suitable waste materials, offering them reduced disposal costs and the potential for shared profits. Additionally, we'll promote our services through local eco-initiatives, online channels, and community events.</p>

<p>MARKET SIZE</p>

<p>Initially, our market size is Austin-based businesses. With an effective model and proven success, we aim to expand to other cities, potentially expanding to a national or global scale.</p>

<p>PROJECTIONS</p>

<p>In our early stages, our costs will likely exceed revenues. However, we expect to reach profitability by year three, as our operations scale and our cooperative community grows.</p>

<p>HOW THIS GETS BIG</p>

<p>We envision ReLeaf becoming a standard for sustainable waste management in Austin and beyond. This includes expansion into new locations and potential diversification of services, always maintaining our core mission of eco-innovation and cooperative ownership.</p>

<p>OWNERSHIP &amp; GOVERNANCE</p>

<p>ReLeaf is owned by its worker members and participating businesses. Decisions are made democratically, with all members having a voice in our direction and operations.</p></div></div><div class="views-field views-field-field-w-a-s-t-e-words"><span class="views-label views-label-field-w-a-s-t-e-words">W.A.S.T.E.: Words Assisting Sustainable Transformation &amp; Ecology </span><div class="field-content"><ul><li><a href="/project-prototyping.html" hreflang="en">Project Prototyping</a>
